# Welcome to the AI Prompts of K7CFO

This repository is a growing collection of **AI prompts and tools** designed to help creators, developers, and professionals get *better, faster, and more consistent results* from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.  
Each prompt is field-tested, written in plain English, and built to solve real-world workflow problems ‚Äî from editing documents safely to designing web apps with AI assistance.

## üß† Keep the Same Text

**Link:** [keep-the-same-text.md](https://github.com/k7cfo/ai-prompts/blob/main/keep-the-same-text.md)

This simple but powerful prompt helps **stop AI from hallucinating** when you‚Äôre editing large documents.  
It acts as a "text anchor" ‚Äî reminding the AI not to rewrite or change your content, only to format or clean it up.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> Not foolproof, but it‚Äôs remarkably effective.  
> Perfect when you just want consistent formatting, layout adjustments, or structure ‚Äî **without altering your actual words.**

Example uses:
- Reformatting blog posts, essays, or contracts  
- Cleaning up markdown or HTML structure  
- Applying a style guide consistently
