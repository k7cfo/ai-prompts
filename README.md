# Welcome to the AI Prompts of K7CFO

This repository is a growing collection of **AI prompts and tools** designed to help creators, developers, and professionals get *better, faster, and more consistent results* from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.  
Each prompt is field-tested, written in plain English, and built to solve real-world workflow problems ‚Äî from editing documents safely to designing web apps with AI assistance.

## üß† Keep the Same Text

**Link:** [keep-the-same-text.md](https://github.com/k7cfo/ai-prompts/blob/main/keep-the-same-text.md)

This simple but powerful prompt helps **stop AI from hallucinating** when you‚Äôre editing large documents.  
It acts as a "text anchor" ‚Äî reminding the AI not to rewrite or change your content, only to format or clean it up.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> Not foolproof, but it‚Äôs remarkably effective.  
> Perfect when you just want consistent formatting, layout adjustments, or structure ‚Äî **without altering your actual words.**

Example uses:
- Reformatting blog posts, essays, or contracts  
- Cleaning up markdown or HTML structure  
- Applying a style guide consistently

## ‚ö° Warp + v0.dev Workflow

**Warp Setup:** [warp/](https://github.com/k7cfo/ai-prompts/tree/main/warp)  
**Learn more:** [warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev/)  
**Paired with:** [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)

This section helps you **configure Warp (a modern terminal)** to behave like [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) ‚Äî a stunning web-based AI code editor built on **shadcn/ui**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a **strict system prompt** for clean, elegant front-end code.

Once configured, you can:
- Develop locally in **Warp**, using prompts that mimic v0.dev‚Äôs structured output  
- Generate and format code directly in your terminal  
- Deploy instantly to **Vercel**, just like in v0.dev  
- Enjoy a seamless **local ‚Üí cloud** development flow

Think of it as bringing v0.dev‚Äôs intelligence and design style into your own command line.
